## Description :green_book:

This project is a simple typing speed test application where users can practice typing skills and measure their typing speed in words per minute (WPM). The application provides a random set of words for the user to type within a specified time limit, and then calculates and displays the typing speed based on the number of correctly typed words.

I also added functionality for calculating user accuracy. You can see it after each attempt in the panel above.
Below the word field there is a menu with buttons where you can increase the number of words in the field or refresh it.

It is worth mentioning that in my application you can enable blind typing mode using the corresponding checkbox.
